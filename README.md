# Title

My portfolio site (in HTML and CSS)
The deployed site is :   https://lokiheim.github.io/myPortfolio/
and the custom 404 page is :   https://lokiheim.github.io/404page/

# Challenges 
- Needs to show my avatar/ name / recent photo (I know its Halloween but am not forcing my face unto anyone ðŸ˜›)
So used a logo maker to make a logo using a terminal line start and my name, also showing my age here decided to use the old green font color using on the really old computer screens.

- Navigation links need to jump to the corresponding sections (may add a scroll to top button at a later point)

- The app image when clicked opens the relevant page on a new tab, those apps that do no have a project, it will tab to a custom 404 error page.

I found that i was going wrong when trying to make the top image in portfolio larger that a h3 was also a child hence :first-child was not working and after uch experimentation I just add an new ID and used that instead. I think CSS is the main reason why DEv's shave their heads or are bald :(


 
# Things I learned
variable is css seem to save time but not to sure with copy and paste.
That the Rebel Alliance has stolen most of my CSS found on my 404 error page, an investigation is pending.
Also CSS is a fickle mistress with whom I am having a love hate realationship, we both love hating each other it seems 

I maybe best suited for the backend. (hand drawn wireframes also included)
